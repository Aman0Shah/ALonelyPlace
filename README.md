# POEMS - Start
## Space, A Time & Place

Couldn’t stop thinking about Space  
It is so empty and far  
he could never forget the Place  
  
So distant and cold, it grew tenfold  
Breaking most of the case  
Couldn’t stop thinking about Space  
  
Ever so expanding, without a trace  
With only god’s grace  
he could never forget the Place  
  
Take the rocket for a spin, and use the interface  
You might need to use the hyperspace  
Couldn’t stop thinking about Space  
  
Just in case,  
Break the barrier to win the race  
he could never forget the Place  
  
So distant and cold, it can replace  
A place of hope, A place to scope  
Couldn’t stop thinking about Space  
he could never forget the Place
