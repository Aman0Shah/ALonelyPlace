## Spoiled Milk (Haiku [5])
Don’t cry over spilled milk  
It was going to be bad anyway  
Smile, it is now cheese  

## not-employment (Free Verse [10])
Don’t believe,  
you are not important.  
Don’t think the dough will be waiting,  
you are not important.  

Like pliable plastic you can proudly say your profoundly poor,  
you are not indispensable  
you are not important.  
Swaying in the wind, you find the drug store.  
you find him on the corner, selling the stuff.  

Getting dumb as dirt,  
you are now an idiot in the eyes of the passerby.  
Wee-U- Wee-U!  
Finding yourself in a cell, with no hope, no life, no family, no soul.  

Thinking life will get better, broke and on the road  
you are not happy, life has left your eyes.  
you are not going to get that dollar slice.  
you are not going to get the spot anymore  
you are not going to get your soul  

Run to the nearest stop to get away  
You hold your heart in your hand as you fade.   
Don’t believe,  
you are no longer important.  


## Couldn't Stop Thinking of Space (Villanelle [10])
Johnson couldn’t stop thinking about space  
It was just so distant and far  
But he could never forget his place  

That night, Johnson encountered the stars of space  
He had to calm himself with physics  
Johnson couldn't stop thinking about space  

Later, Johnson was spooked by a mace  
He tried to focus on his favorite lyrics  
But he could never forget his place  

Aman tired to distract him with a brake  
Said it was time to start thinking about Civics  
Though Johnson couldn’t stop thinking about space  

Johnson took running like in a race  
Space was distant like a hieroglyphic  
But he could never forget his place  

Johnson might be put on the case  
His mind turned to statistics  
Johnson couldn't stop thinking about space  
But he could never forget his place  

## Crazy Milk (Sonnet [20])
You are so crazy and I must agree  
You need some chocolate milk right now for free  
I won’t be giving it away, you see  
In all its form, from whole to 2%  

Milk is a beverage that’s hard to beat.  
It’s packed with nutrients and calcium,  
so it’s good for the body as well as the soul.  
Whether you drink it straight from the carton  

or use it in your favorite recipes,  
milk is a versatile and nourishing drink  
It’s a delicious, refreshing treat  
that has something to offer everyone.  

So next time you’re feeling thirsty,  
reach for a glass of milk and be free.

## About the Author: AMAN NIKHIL SHAH ([10])
<img style="float: right;" src="stickfigure.jpg">
Aman Shah is a Senior at Gretchen Whitney High School, graduating on June 8th 2022! 
He played Tennis on a regular basis at Don Knabe Regional Park and is on the official Whitney Tennis Team. He participated in Model United Nations and has done so for 4 years now, racking multiple awards ranging from Best Delegate to Accommodation. He loves to contribute to the community and will continue to go to M.U.N conferences at UC Berkeley. In his spare time, which has gotten significantly larger in the past few weeks, Aman enjoys speedrunning video games like: MarioKart and Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks. As a HUGE Nintendo Fan Boy, Aman was super excited to receive a Nintendo Switch OLED edition for graduation. Further, he takes delight in cooking for his family, and spending time with them. 

Aman is about to enter a new phase of his life, where he is super excited to leave Cerritos - a place he called home for his whole life, 18 plus years - to embark on a journey nearly 400 miles away. He believes that he will enjoy his time there and continue to pursue his dream of becoming an Immunologist. He will never forget the friends, family, and educators he has left behind. The times at Grad Nite and how they mischievously stole his food to make him spend more money. Or the times he enjoyed being on a Zoom call with his friends after online classes to grind for Math Anal. Aman is happy to take this leap with a few other Whitney students. Because he needs to leave early for the Summer session, he will only have a few weeks after graduation to really enjoy summer. He has made plans to go visit a few national parks and Las Vegas. As a first time going, Aman has high hopes for this well deserved vacation.
