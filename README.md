# Poem #1 - Space, A Time & Place

Couldn’t stop thinking about Space
It is so empty and far
he could never forget the Place

So distant and cold, it grew tenfold
Breaking most of the case 
Couldn’t stop thinking about Space

Ever so expanding, without a trace
With only god’s grace
he could never forget the Place

Take the rocket for a spin, and use the interface
You might need to use the hyperspace
Couldn’t stop thinking about Space

Just in case,
Break the barrier to win the race
he could never forget the Place

So distant and cold, it can replace
A place of hope, A place to scope
Couldn’t stop thinking about Space
he could never forget the Place
