# POEMS - Start
## Space, A Time & Place
Couldn’t stop thinking about Space  
It is so empty and far  
he could never forget the Place  
  
So distant and cold, it grew tenfold  
Breaking most of the case  
Couldn’t stop thinking about Space  
  
Ever so expanding, without a trace  
With only god’s grace  
he could never forget the Place  
  
Take the rocket for a spin, and use the interface  
You might need to use the hyperspace  
Couldn’t stop thinking about Space  
  
Just in case,  
Break the barrier to win the race  
he could never forget the Place  
  
So distant and cold, it can replace  
A place of hope, A place to scope  
Couldn’t stop thinking about Space  
he could never forget the Place  
  
## Ocean, Roaring Waves
The sea, is vast and furious  
Crushes the ships under its thumb  
She is gentle but rude, to invaders  
  
She cares for the creatures within  
Poisoned by the those who don’t care  
The sea, is vast and furious  
  
She provides, being taken advantage of  
Crying, Sad, Depressed, she is Alone  
She is gentle but rude, to invaders  
  
Why she asks, for help she doesn’t get  
Why she asks, as crude gets dumped  
The sea, is vast and furious  
  
No one cares for her friends  
Her hands are tied  
She is gentle but rude, to invaders  
  
She weeps, she pleads, no one listens  
Alone, in such a large world she roars  
The sea, is vast and furious  
She is gentle but rude, to invaders  
  
## Desert, Not Dessert
Bone-Dry, with only a lizard passing by  
A villager separated from the pack, lost  
Only time can tell if anyone can survive  
  
Not a drop in site, can’t get ready for that fight  
Separated from the pack, not a civilian in site, can’t get ready for that fight  
Bone-Dry, with only a lizard passing by  
  
Help isn’t on its way  
Lost from civilization, all a lone  
Only time can tell if anyone can survive  
  
Hoping for a plater, only cactus for him  
No dessert his way, no water in site  
Bone-Dry, with only a lizard passing by  
  
Fights to survive, can’t see his pack  
No Dessert, No Food, No Water  
Only time can tell if anyone can survive  
  
Mind twisting, turning, out of control  
Only Desert for miles, nothing in site  
Bone-Dry, with only a lizard passing by  
Only time can tell if anyone can survive  
  
## Jungle, Here’s my Fury
Green vines all around, the jaguar crys  
The lone wolf of the jungle  
He roars, eyes blazing, power unspoken  
  
He lurks in the shadow, pouncing at the right time  
No friends, he is the hero in his own story  
Green vines all around, the jaguar crys  
  
Pain in his eyes, not trusted by his friend  
The Brutus of all the animals, a traitor to all  
He roars, eyes blazing, power unspoken  
  
Agile, Nimble, and ready at all times  
Sometimes thought to be a backstabber, just a offender, he’s a cat  
Green vines all around, the jaguar crys  
  
Why? He pleads, he prays. The Lone Wolf of the Jungle.  
He hunts by himself, he eats by himself  
He roars, eyes blazing, power unspoken  
  
His fury masked, sad, wanting more  
No trust, just the flame of his’s fury  
Green vines all around, the jaguar crys  
He roars, eyes blazing, power unspoken  
  
## Urban, Dust & Debris
Cars, Buses, Trains, Planes zipping around   
Polluting mostly everything in their path  
Not a care about the planet as they move  
  
Many speak for God’s Wonder,  
Many adjourn, rejecting the pollution's effect  
Cars, Buses, Trains, Planes zipping around  
  
Earth crumbles, wilts, dies away  
Providing life to these ungrateful peasants  
Not a care about the planet as they move  
  
Rummaging through Mother E.  
Sucking the life out of her  
Cars, Buses, Trains, Planes zipping around  
  
She will fade if nothing is done  
Factories pump, gush, slew more vehicles - it’s only just begun  
Not a care about the planet as they move  
  
Rushing for a late appointment, what a disappointment,  
Can’t be fixed with an ointment  
Cars, Buses, Trains, Planes zipping around  
Not a care about the planet as they move  
  
## The Flower Tree
The flower grew such  
it wanted to be a tree  
alone in a field  
  
## Spoiled Milk  
Don’t cry over spilled milk  
It was going to be bad anyway  
Smile, it is now cheese  
  
## Life Once Again  
Life moves on despite,  
You giving permission to it  
Enjoy, what you have, ok?  
  
## So …  
Look around it's free  
Animals can roam the Earth pleased  
So, don’t put a fee  
  

## science  
Life as we know it  
So young, so beautiful  
It shall grow forever
